# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to our documentation! This guide explains how you can help improve our docs for all products and features.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to contribute is directly from the documentation page:

1. Click the **"Edit this page on GitHub"** link at the bottom of any doc page
2. GitHub will automatically fork the repository for you
3. Make your changes in the web editor
4. Submit a Pull Request

<Callout type="info">
  You don't need to be a developer to contribute! Fixing typos, improving clarity, or adding examples are all valuable contributions.
</Callout>

## What Can You Contribute?

- **Fix typos and grammar** - Every improvement helps
- **Clarify confusing sections** - If something is unclear to you, it's probably unclear to others too
- **Add examples** - Code samples, use cases, or real-world scenarios
- **Translate content** - Help make docs available in more languages
- **Add new topics** - Missing documentation? Add it!
- **Document upcoming features** - Help document products that are "coming soon"

## Contribution Workflow

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

If you haven't already, fork the [docs repository](https://github.com/flomks/weareo.fun) on GitHub.

### Step 2: Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b fix-typo-in-authentication
```

### Step 3: Make Your Changes

Edit the MDX files in the appropriate product folder (e.g., `content/docs/ollm/` for OLLM docs). You can use:

- **Markdown** for text formatting
- **MDX Components** like `<Callout>`, `<CodeBlock>`, and `<ApiExample>`
- **Frontmatter** for metadata (title, description)

<CodeBlock language="mdx">
{`---
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "A brief description"
---

# Your Content

<Callout type="warning">
  Important information here!
</Callout>`}
</CodeBlock>

### Step 4: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix typo in authentication guide"
git push origin fix-typo-in-authentication
```

### Step 5: Open a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Describe your changes
4. Submit the PR

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized by product:

```
content/docs/
  ├─ ollm/              # OLLM documentation
  ├─ [product-name]/    # Other product docs
  └─ how-to-contribute.mdx  # This file
```

When contributing to a specific product, place your files in the corresponding folder. For new products or "coming soon" features, create a new folder following the same structure.

## MDX Guidelines

### Available Components

- `<Callout type="info|warning|error">` - Highlight important information
- `<CodeBlock language="typescript">` - Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- `<ApiExample method="POST" endpoint="/v1/auth" />` - API endpoint examples

### Writing Style

- Be clear and concise
- Use examples when possible
- Link to related documentation
- Keep paragraphs short
- Use consistent terminology

### Frontmatter

Every MDX file should start with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "Brief description for search and previews"
---
```

## Contributing to "Coming Soon" Products

If you're contributing documentation for products that are still in development:

- Use the `<Callout type="warning">` component to indicate beta/early access status
- Clearly mark experimental features
- Include version information when relevant
- Link to related stable documentation

<Callout type="warning">
  This feature is currently in development. Documentation may change as the feature evolves.
</Callout>

## Localization

If you're contributing translations:

- Create a file with the language suffix: `filename.de.mdx` or `filename.es.mdx`
- Keep the same structure and frontmatter
- Translate the content while maintaining technical accuracy
- Place translated files in the same folder as the original
